A crystal clear watch face, with LCD-like goal meter segments, written while snow crystals were falling during an unusually cold spell of weather here in England.

Features (depending on watch support):
- Big time digits right in the middle, with hours in bold. Leading zero and seconds can be hidden. Hours and minutes colours can be set independently.
- Up to 3 customisable data fields: HR (historical/live), battery, notifications, calories, distance, alarms, altitude, thermometer, sunrise/sunset, weather (OpenWeatherMap).
- Up to 3 customisable indicators: Bluetooth, alarms, notifications, Bluetooth/notifications, battery.
- 2 customisable meters: steps, floors climbed, active minutes (weekly), battery, calories (custom goal). The meters have auto-scaling segments and current/target value display.
- Move bar.
- 12 colour themes.

The techie bit: to save your watch battery, the goal meters and move bar are drawn from a palette-restricted back buffer, for improved drawing performance, with minimal memory penalty.

This is my first ever Connect IQ watch face (please be kind!), so I look forward to your feedback, improving the watch face, and bringing it to more devices.
